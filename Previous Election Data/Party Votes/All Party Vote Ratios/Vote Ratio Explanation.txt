An Explanation of Vote Ratios

Vote ratios are the ratio of the percentage of party vote received by a party in a
given electorate to the percentage of vote received in that type of electorate (general
or Maori)

The Single Year Maori v General Party Vote shows the ratio for a given party for a given
year

N.B. For the Green Party and Alliance there was not a clear difference and so the total
vote share was used
